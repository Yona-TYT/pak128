<br>
From your visit of the art exhibition you can remember the following information:<br>
<br>
A very self-confident manager of <a href="{jfk_pos}">JFK airport</a> gave you
- very inconspicuous - a letter. The airport would like to be greater than the
<a href="{lag_pos}">La Guardia</a> and <a href="{new_pos}">Newark</a> airport together.
Therfore they count the departing passengers, mail and good at these
airports. If you can help them you will get a amount of {jfk_cash} for
each more departing from JFK as by the competitors. Keep the unhappy
at JFK below {jfk_max_unhappy} passengers.<br>
<br>
The big group of representatives from the tourism committee informed
you about the world known tourismus business in new york city.
To participate in this just build up stations and start passanger service.
You will get {tourism_cash} for each happy if you sucessfuly manage it
at all places together. In your trouser pocket you find a note:<br>
{tourism_places}
By the way, the station can be larger than one map tile, there must
be only one part at the place. Watch the three coordinates.<br>
<br>
Taking a small snack from the extensive buffet you meet the
tax office director. He knows that there will be soon a new tax,
starting januar {tax_start}. It is a sales tax of {tax_rate}% to be
payed monthly, without exception!<br>
<br>
A influential member from Harlem - marked from his daily business
with violent and crime - knows about your problem that
there is too much crime in <a href="(376,255)">Harlem</a> and
<a href="(428,272)">East Harlem</a> to build up tram ways. He
offers you to reduce the crime if the {harlem_name_food} and
the {harlem_name_beer} reach both a production level
of {harlem_level} unit/month.<br>
<br>
A real estate broker, very well dressed, let you know a bit more
about the construction costs of corporate office buildings. It's
starts around 9 million $ and raises to 81 million $ for a huge
representative headquarter.<br>
<br>
The plant manager at a {refinery_name} near St. George would like
to sell his gasoline to the airport dealers. He employed a lot of
workers, but didn't have any transport system for his products and
consumption. Fortunately he has a great influential to the city council
to get a decision to be allowed to build taxiways and runways.
Just take care that his plant can produce a minimum
of {refinery_gasoline} gasoline unit/month and you will get your airport
construction tools.<br>
<br>
The chief executive officer of a large mining operation offers you to
get all necessary city council decisions to do underground workings
below the waterline. You just need to get his {mining_name1} and
{mining_name2} productiv. To get the decisions for a level you need
following amount of production within twelve month:<br>
{mining_levels}
To protect the deep sea the city council will never allow
underground workings below levels {mining_max}.<br>
<br>
Do you like fried chicken? The owner of the famous Simutrans Fried Chicken (SFC)
fastfood company asked you to supply all of his stores with
{chicken_min} units/month with chicken meat.
He is sure that for each supported store the local city growth will
increase one tenth of consumed meat every month. Sure, it's the best
food in town. Here is a list of his stores:<br>{chicken_list}<br>
<br>
The district representatives of the Simutrans Postal Service, a huge and
influential company also noticed your problem with the airport construction
tools. He believes his problem can be solved by you. Reach a mail service
of {mail_level}% in {cityname} for him and he takes care to get the tools.<br>
<br>
Be part of the big business. The {car_name} is starting to produce the new
car model. The sales manager offers a commission of {car_cash} for each
car produced if they produce more than {car_level} cars/month. Everytime
the production is lower than in the previous month you have to pay a fine
of {car_fine} for each car less and be sure that the individual traffic
will increase even if only a few cars are sold.<br>
<br>
The advertisement from the new electric company is conspicuous.
A very young woman, responsible for the marketing, showed you
the new product. It's my be product for the future, but it so
simple like a apple. Her great knowledge of the consumers let her
predict that the growth of <a href="(335,497)">Hoboken</a>,
<a href="(397,522)">SoHo</a> and <a href="(451,515)">Lower East Side</a> will
end if the {electro_name} sells {electro_level} elelctronic units/month.<br>
<br>
Involved in a conversation while you consider a work of art
a incredibly rich and well known person told you by the way
that there is an unwritten law, for rich people with a net
wealth form more than {charity_min}. The expectant attitude
is to donate {charity_rate}/1000 of your net wealth for charity
projects monthly.<br>
<br>
His grandmother, as old as he is rich, told you from the last
century where the citizens were jubilant because of an excellent
puplic transport system and mail service. It reached incredible rates
above {babyboom_level}%. And that was the last time of a babyboom
in all towns of the city.<br>
<br>
A successful craftsman obtains its products from the
{wholesale_name} in Harlem. Unfortunately not all of
his needed goods are in the storage. He is confident that if all products
are support at least {wholesale_level} units in the storage, the towns
<a href="(313,230)">Edgewater</a>, <a href="(318,287)">Fairview</a> and
<a href="(368,182)">Washington Heights</a> will have a monthly extra
growth of {wholesale_growth} citizens.<br>
<br>
The daughter of the owner from a fancy hotel chain didn't like waste
at her favorite places of the city. She persuaded her father to pay
you the same amount as the tourism committee is paying you, if there
will be less waste in the city. So take care that each garbage dump
deliver a minimum of {waste_level} units/month.<br>
{waste_list}<br>
<br>
It was already late, wenn you noticed a city council member
- probably a bit drunk - talking about a loan rate free credit for poor
transport companies. The credit from a hugh downtown bank will have an
amount of {bank_credit} for a period of {bank_month} month. You are
not sure, but to get the credit in the beginning of the year
{bank_start} your company must have less then {bank_assets} net wealth.
Yes - you remember correctly - it was less! This will be much better
than to pay the bank an overdraft rate of {overdraft_rate}% each month.<br>
